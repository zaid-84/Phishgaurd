            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Our phishing detection tool uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze URLs for common characteristics of phishing websites. The system examines multiple factors including:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>Domain age and registration information</li>
                <li>URL structure and redirects</li>
                <li>SSL certificate validity</li>
                <li>Website content analysis</li>
                <li>Comparison with known phishing databases</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you submit a URL, our system processes these factors and provides you with a risk assessment in seconds.</p>
